 modes depending on their actions in battle.

 allies' HP will learn Healer.

  enemy. Others, like Slice & Dice', hit all enemies.

  Try to use each Overdrive to its fullest.

  the clock ticks down. Hit 1 to stop each reel.
 Different combinations yield different results.

  Element Reels'

  Match up ice, fire, water, and lightning symbols.

  A two of a kind fires an elemental shot at one enemy.
